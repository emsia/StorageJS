The feature "wrappedWrites" will modify the following methods:

 - storage.set(key, value)
 - storage.remove(key)
 - storage.clear()   [if present]
 
 When this feture is included, all write access to storage
 will be wrapped in try/catch blocks, and the above mentioned
 methods will return false if an Error occurred within write
 access and true if not.
 
 Note that this is an expensive thing to do!
